Avatars is an avatar placeholder library for designers and developers. You can choose between simple identicons and
lovely designed characters. And best of all: We provide a simple and free HTTP API that you can use right away!

You can start directly with our free [HTTP-API](/docs/http-api) or alternatively use the
[JavaScript library](/docs/installation).
